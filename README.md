# Practical NLP Applications: Text Mining, Spam Detection, and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview  
This repository demonstrates **end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflows** applied to real-world text problems.  
It showcases how to preprocess text, extract features, perform clustering, classify spam messages, and analyze sentiment using both **machine learning** and **lexicon-based approaches**.  

This project is structured into **four mini case studies**:  

1. **Text Preprocessing Pipeline** → tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation & number cleaning, stemming, lemmatization.  
2. **Document Clustering (Unsupervised)** → TF-IDF + KMeans clustering to group similar texts.  
3. **SMS Spam Classification (Supervised)** → TF-IDF features + MLP neural network for spam detection.  
4. **Sentiment Analysis** → Lexicon-based analysis using **TextBlob** and **VADER**.

## Objectives  

- Build **robust preprocessing pipelines** for text normalization.  
- Apply **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature engineering.  
- Explore both **unsupervised (clustering)** and **supervised (classification)** NLP tasks.  
- Implement **spam detection** with a neural network classifier.  
- Evaluate **sentiment polarity** of text using lexicon-based approaches.  
- Save and reuse trained models with `pickle` (optional).
